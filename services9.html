                        <p>The Confederation Bridge is a 12.9-kilometer (8.0 mi) long bridge that connects the province of New Brunswick with the island of Prince Edward Island (PEI) in Canada. It is the longest bridge in the world over ice-covered waters and was opened on May 31, 1997, by Queen Elizabeth II.

                            The idea of building a fixed link between PEI and the mainland can be traced back to the late 19th century, but it wasn't until 1986 that the federal and provincial governments reached an agreement to construct the bridge. The project was undertaken by Strait Crossing Inc., a private consortium that would design, build, and operate the bridge for 35 years, after which ownership would be transferred to the Canadian government.
                            
                            Construction began in 1993, with a total of 62 piers being built. The bridge is a box-girder design, with the roadway suspended from a series of arches. The main span of the bridge is 250 meters (820 feet) long, and the highest point of the bridge is about 40 meters (131 feet) above the water level.
                            
                            To minimize the impact on the environment and marine life, construction took place during the winter months when the water was frozen. The bridge was built using precast concrete segments, which were fabricated in a nearby construction yard and then transported to the bridge site by barge.
                            
                            The Confederation Bridge has a speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph) and features a 5-meter (16 feet) wide pedestrian walkway on one side of the bridge. The bridge is designed to withstand ice and harsh winter conditions, with a lifespan of at least 100 years.
                            
                            The Confederation Bridge has significantly improved transportation and accessibility to PEI, making it easier for tourists and residents to travel to and from the island. It has also become an iconic symbol of the province and a source of pride for its residents.</p>
