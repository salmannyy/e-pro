                        <p>The Eiserner Steg, or Iron Footbridge, is a pedestrian bridge in Frankfurt, Germany, that spans the river Main and connects the city center with the district of Sachsenhausen. The first wrought iron bridge was built in 1868, replacing an earlier wooden bridge. It was designed by Johann Peter Wilhelm Schmick and was 170 meters long, consisting of riveted steel trusses with two bridge piers.

                            In 1911-1912, the bridge was raised due to the canalization of the Main River and the increase in shipping traffic. A new steel structure was built on the old pilings, and the bridge was widened and lengthened. Unfortunately, the bridge was blown up by the Wehrmacht in the final days of World War II, but it was rebuilt in 1946. The bridge was once again raised by 40 cm in 1969 due to insufficient clearance for ships.
                            
                            A thorough renewal and restoration of the bridge took place in 1992-1993, and it was reopened on February 27, 1993. The Eiserner Steg is now a popular tourist attraction, with thousands of locks of love attached to its railings. The bridge offers fantastic views of the city skyline, known as "Mainhatten," and the museums along the Main River in Sachsenhausen.</p>
