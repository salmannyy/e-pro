                        <p>The Brooklyn Bridge, which connects Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City, was completed in 1883 and was designed by John Augustus Roebling. Roebling had originally planned to take final compass readings for the bridge's construction, but while doing so, a boat crushed his foot against a piling. His foot had to be amputated, and he ultimately died from tetanus just a few days after placing his son, Washington Roebling, in charge of the project.

                            Construction on the bridge began in 1870, with the initial step being the creation of solid foundations using "caissons," or closed wooden boxes placed underwater and filled with compressed air to allow workers to dig the riverbed. However, this method came with the risk of "caisson disease," a form of decompression sickness that affected many workers, including Washington Roebling, who became partially paralyzed and bedridden as a result. Roebling's wife, Emily Warren Roebling, stepped in to assist and supervise the construction for the next 11 years.
                            
                            The bridge was opened to the public on May 24, 1883, with thousands of people in attendance. The opening ceremony was presided over by President Chester A. Arthur and New York Governor Grover Cleveland, and Emily Roebling was the first person to cross the bridge.
                            
                            At the time of its completion, the Brooklyn Bridge was the longest bridge in the world, with a total length of 1825 meters. It remained the longest until 1903, and its cost was $15.5 million, with 27 lives lost during construction.
                            
                            On May 30, 1883, just six days after the bridge opened, a rumor spread that it was going to collapse, causing a stampede that resulted in the trampling and death of twelve people. To dispel rumors about the bridge's stability and promote his circus, P. T. Barnum led 21 elephants across the bridge on May 17, 1884.
                            
                            John Augustus Roebling designed the bridge to be six times stronger than necessary, ensuring its longevity.</p>
