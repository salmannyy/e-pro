                        <p>Tower Bridges  -is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London that was constructed between 1886 and 1894. It was designed by Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry with the help of Henry Marc Brunel. The bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping. Originally hydraulically powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The bridge is part of the London Inner Ring Road and remains an important traffic route with 40,000 crossings every day. The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways, and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition. The bridge has become a recognizable London landmark and is sometimes confused with London Bridge, about 0.5 miles (800 m) upstream. The construction of the bridge was driven by the increased commercial development in the East End of London in the late 19th century, which led to demand for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. The design and construction of the bridge was a complex process, involving many different contractors and engineers, and took eight years to complete. The bridge has undergone several renovations and repairs throughout its history, including a major refurbishment in 2008, and continues to be an important transportation link in London.
