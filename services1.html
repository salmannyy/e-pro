                        <p>The Tsing Ma Bridge is a suspension bridge in Hong Kong that connects Tsing Yi and Ma Wan islands. It was built to provide access to Lantau Island, where Hong Kong's airport was being constructed. The bridge was completed in 1997 and is the world's ninth-longest span suspension bridge, with a main span of 1,377 meters. It has two decks and carries both road and rail traffic, making it the largest suspension bridge of its type. The bridge was designed by Mott MacDonald and constructed by a joint venture of Costain, Mitsui, and Trafalgar House. It is a prominent element of the Lantau Link, an infrastructure project that connects Lantau Island to the urbanized areas of Hong Kong. The bridge was inaugurated by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1997. It is the longest suspension bridge in the world that carries rail traffic. The bridge is 41 meters wide and has a total length of about 2.2 kilometers. The towers of the bridge are 206 meters tall.</p>
